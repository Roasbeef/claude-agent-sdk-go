# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
go build ./...                          # Build
go test ./...                           # Unit tests
go test -v -run TestName ./...          # Single test
make lint                               # Run linter (must pass)
make test-integration                   # Integration tests (needs API token)
make test-race                          # Unit tests with race detector
```

Integration tests require `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Without a token, they skip (not fail). Always run `make test-integration` after changes that affect CLI communication.

## Verifying Changes

**All changes must pass tests and lint before committing.**

After modifying code:
1. `go build ./...` - must pass
2. `go test ./...` - unit tests must pass
3. `make lint` - linter must pass (no warnings)
4. `make test-integration` - run if touching client.go, protocol.go, transport.go, or message handling

For new features, check coverage: `make coverage`

## Architecture

This SDK wraps the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess, communicating via JSON over stdin/stdout. See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the full architecture and [docs/cli-protocol.md](docs/cli-protocol.md) for the wire protocol.

**Key files**:
- `client.go` - `Client`, `Stream`, `Query()` using `iter.Seq[Message]`
- `protocol.go` - Control messages, hooks, MCP routing
- `transport.go` - Subprocess lifecycle, stdin/stdout pipes
- `mcp.go` - In-process MCP server with generics-based tools
- `ask_user.go` - `QuestionMessage` for interactive Q&A

## Code Style

- Use `go doc` to look up APIs when unsure
- Comments are complete sentences ending with periods
- Comments focus on the why/how instead of the plain what

## Integration Test Patterns

```go
opts := append(isolatedClientOptions(t),
    WithSystemPrompt("..."),
    WithPermissionMode(PermissionModeBypassAll),
)
```

Use `skipIfNoToken(t)` and `skipIfNoCLI(t)` at the start.
